# Minecraft-Server-Plugin
Plugin for my own purposes.
Uploaded to github just for my portfolio =)

Here is a list of some funcs of it:
1) Create | Delete | Teleport -- Warp system.
2) Count nearby tamed entities.
3) AutoFeed -- Feed all your tamed nearby entities. Helpfully when you have the big farms.
4) Whiste -- Teleport all your tamed wolves/cats, which aren't sitting now.
5) Tamed wolves will not attack each other, including players.
6) Home -- Teleport you to your bed.
